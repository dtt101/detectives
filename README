== Sherlock

Pros: 

Excellent on a crime scene
Peerless at deduction
The spark of creative genius that enable him to solve the toughest mysteries
Stylish

Cons:
His treatment of Doctor Watson and Mrs Hudson often leaves a lot to be desired
His arrogance often comes at a cost of some anxiety to his clients

== Hercule

Pros:
Another expert at finding clues
Amazing senstivity to relationships between strangers
Fantastic deductive ability

Cons:
Annoying mannerisms
His attitude towards Hastings is absolutely reprehensible
The bodycount in his investigations is unacceptable, rarely does he avoid one or more repeat murders

== Columbo

Pros:
Humble, yet with a downbeat charm
As a detective in the modern world, he solves arguably more sophisticated cases than his Victorian forebears
A true genius, who never lets a case go 'Just one more thing...'


Cons:
The murderer usually is the creepy one with the sleek hairdo. It is possible Columbo has noticed this

== Magnum

Pros:
Nice shirt. Nice car. Great 'tache.
Useful when things get physical.
A certain naive intellect, charm and luck that took him through cases that he may not otherwise stood a chance in

Cons:
Possibly not the brightest of buttons. Took him at least 5 series to work out that Higgins was Robin Masters.
Weakness for women he finds attractive.

== Miss Marple

Pros:
Her slow, information gathering approach is a proven success
Excellent at gathering clues that others would be ignored.
She rocks the old lady shtick, and is often underestimated.

Cons:
If it comes to a throw down, she can be in your gang.
Body-count! Just like Poirot, she struggles to keep on lid on the deaths.

== Father Brown

Pros:
A great listener, able to solve cases with the minimum of intervention.
Uses his bumbling priestly exterior to great effect, never putting the criminal on guard.
Another astonishing mind, and open to all conclusions.

Cons:
Like Miss Marple, he does not bring much ruckus. 
His cases are often idiosyncratic to say the least. One wonders how he would cope if transplanted into, as an example, 1970's Chicago.
