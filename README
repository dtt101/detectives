A project to discover who is the greatest detective, building on the Meteor leaderboard example, to no great effect.

== Father Brown

Pros:
A great listener, able to solve cases with the minimum of intervention.
Uses his bumbling priestly exterior to great effect, never putting the criminal on guard.
Another astonishing mind, and open to all conclusions.

Cons:
Like Miss Marple, he does not bring much ruckus. 
His cases are often idiosyncratic to say the least. One wonders how he would cope if transplanted into, as an example, 1970's Chicago.
