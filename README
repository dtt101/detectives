A project to discover who is the greatest detective, building on the Meteor leaderboard example, to no great effect.

== Magnum

Pros:
Nice shirt. Nice car. Great 'tache.
Useful when things get physical.
A certain naive intellect, charm and luck that took him through cases that he may not otherwise stood a chance in

Cons:
Possibly not the brightest of buttons. Took him at least 5 series to work out that Higgins was Robin Masters.
Weakness for women he finds attractive.

== Miss Marple

Pros:
Her slow, information gathering approach is a proven success
Excellent at gathering clues that others would be ignored.
She rocks the old lady shtick, and is often underestimated.

Cons:
If it comes to a throw down, she can be in your gang.
Body-count! Just like Poirot, she struggles to keep on lid on the deaths.

== Father Brown

Pros:
A great listener, able to solve cases with the minimum of intervention.
Uses his bumbling priestly exterior to great effect, never putting the criminal on guard.
Another astonishing mind, and open to all conclusions.

Cons:
Like Miss Marple, he does not bring much ruckus. 
His cases are often idiosyncratic to say the least. One wonders how he would cope if transplanted into, as an example, 1970's Chicago.
